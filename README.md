# QR Code Menu for Restaurants

This project allows restaurants to generate unique QR codes for their menu, offering a faster, more hygienic, and eco-friendly solution for customers to view the menu. By scanning a simple QR code, customers can view the menu on their smartphones, reducing the need for physical menus, minimizing wait times, and reducing paper waste.

## Features

- **Unique QR Code Generation:** Generate a unique QR code for your restaurantâ€™s menu.
- **Customer Convenience:** Customers can instantly access the menu via a QR code, reducing wait times.
- **Eco-Friendly:** No need for paper menus, helping to reduce waste.
- **Hygienic:** Minimize physical contact by allowing customers to view the menu on their devices.

```

### Step 6: Run the Server Locally

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Step 7: If using Gunicorn - Production

| PostgreSQL on Render offers free hosting for 30 days. After that, you can choose a paid plan. | After 30 days, run the project locally to check if it works.                                                                          |
| Render does not allow to run pre-deployment commands in the free plan.                        | Create a custom command and list down all the commands you want to run before deployment and then the command to run the WSGI server. |

## Deployment

For production deployment, I recommend using Gunicorn as the WSGI server and PostgreSQL for the database.

If you are hosting on Render or a similar platform, ensure you configure your environment variables, PYTHON_VERSION and database connection settings correctly.
