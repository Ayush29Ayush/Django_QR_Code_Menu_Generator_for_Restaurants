#!Need of QR Code Menu for Restaurants:
1. Unique QR code for any restaurant's menu.
2. Reduce the wait time for customers.
3. Helps reduce paper waste.
4. Hygienic as customers can scan the QR code to view the menu rather than touch the menu.

#! Project Needs:
1. .env file (python-decouple)
2. Database - PostgreSQL (check settings.py)
3. Pillow and qrcode (check requirements.txt)
4. restaurant name and google drive link for menu (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aewCRp1hJDXPm-xyy-llZUqE6gZuzYyH/view?usp=sharing)
5. Gunicorn as WSGI server for deployment

#! Commands:
1. python3 -m venv venv
2. source venv/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. python3 manage.py migrate
5. python3 manage.py createsuperuser
6. python3 manage.py collectstatic
7. python3 manage.py runserver or gunicorn django_qr_project.wsgi:application
8. python3 manage.py setup_project_and_run

#! Issue and Solution:
Issue: PostgreSQL on Render offers free hosting for 30 days. After that, you can choose a paid plan. 
Solution: After 30 days, run the project locally to check if it works.

Issue: Render does not allow to run pre-deployment commands in free plan.
Solution: Create a custom command and list down all the commands you want to run before deployment and then the command to run the WSGI server. (Refer my setup_project_and_run.py)
